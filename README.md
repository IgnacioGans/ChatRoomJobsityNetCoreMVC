## About the challenge

It's a challenge that jobsity give me to do the Chat Room for five (5) days.
It's the last part of the interview to apply for an open job position. 
I choose Net Core MVC for this challenge, It's my first time using SignalR (i had heard about this in a previous job but never had used it before).
Since this is my first time with SignalR, I had to read very fast the documentation of SignalR to understand the basic setting or basic configuration to create this chat in the project.

## Conclusion

It's was fun to do this challenge and even more fun to create this chat. Recommnendation for beginners: If you have basic knowledge about C# and understanding of html, css and javascript to build websites, then basically you can do this exercise in a minimum functionality. I recommended to read more the documentation and try to build more complex functionality with SignalR.
