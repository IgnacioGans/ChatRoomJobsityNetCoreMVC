## About the challenge

It's a challenge that jobsity give me to do the Chat Room for five (5) days.
It's part of the interview to apply a job. 
I choose Net Core MVC for this challenge, It's my first time using SignalR (i heard before with my last job).
So i have to read very fast the documentation of SignalR to understand the basic setting or basic configuration to create this chat on the project.

## Conclussion

it's was fun to do this challenge and more fun to create this chat, personally i was thinking this gonna be hard, but if you have a little basic knowledge about C# and some code to build a website, basically can do this exercise in a minimum functionality. I recommended to read more the documentation and try to build more complex functionality with SignalR.
